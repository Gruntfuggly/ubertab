# Ubertab

Makes the tab key more useful...

- indents when at the start of the line
- moves to the next bounding character when in the middle of the line
- jumps out of brackets, braces, quotes, etc.
- moves to the next non-space item

Turn it on and off using the status bar button: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gruntfuggly/ubertab/master/button.png">
